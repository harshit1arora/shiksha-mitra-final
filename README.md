# Shiksha Mitra – Teaching Coach

**A voice-first, just-in-time classroom coaching app for government school teachers**

---

## 📌 Overview

**Shiksha Mitra – Teaching Coach** is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to support **government school teachers during real classroom moments**.

Instead of periodic workshops or post-class feedback, Shiksha Mitra provides **instant, context-aware guidance at the moment of teaching**, helping teachers manage engagement, mixed learning levels, and concept clarity — **without surveillance, scoring, or evaluation**.

The product is built with a strong focus on **teacher dignity, education equity, and real-world classroom constraints** such as low bandwidth, limited resources, and high student diversity.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In public education systems:

- Teacher training is **episodic**, but classroom challenges are **daily**
- Academic support visits are **infrequent and delayed**
- Teachers face **live classroom struggles alone**

There is a missing layer of **moment-of-practice support** for teachers.

- Just-in-time classroom coaching
